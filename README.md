# Drupal 7 field for RightsStatement.org

The module implements a field to contain a value from http://rightsstatements.org
to assist cultural heritage institutions in providing clear and easy to use indicators
of the copyright status of their content.
 
The module also implements a configuration page to decide on if and how the statement
will be linked.
